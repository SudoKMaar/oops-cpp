## Introduction

In my second semester of college, I delved into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. This repository serves as a record of my journey in mastering the principles of OOP, from basic concepts like classes and objects to advanced topics like operator overloading, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## List of Experiments

Explore a variety of experiments in this repository, covering different aspects of OOP in C++:

1. Experiment 01: Print "Hello C++".
2. Experiment 02: Print your age.
3. Experiment 03: Check whether a number is odd or even.
4. Experiment 04: Calculate the grade of a student.
5. Experiment 05: Demonstrate the use of the switch statement.
6. Experiment 06: Print the first 5 natural numbers using a for loop.
7. Experiment 07: Use the while loop.
8. Experiment 08: Use the goto statement.
9. Experiment 09: Use the Static Keyword.
10. Experiment 10: Use the break statement.
11. Experiment 11: Use a constructor.
12. Experiment 12: Use a destructor.

26. Experiment 31: Sum complex numbers using operator overloading and friend function.
27. Experiment 32: Find the largest of two using templates.
28. Experiment 33: Display a function template.
29. Experiment 34: Overload function template to display data.
30. Experiment 35: Overload function template using different placeholders.
